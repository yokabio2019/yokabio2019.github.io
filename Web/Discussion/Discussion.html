		<h1>Summary</h1>
		<div class="space"></div>
		<p>This time, the production of DNA origami, the design and experiment of the DNA circuit, and the implementation of the circuit using the origami and the implementation  of  the  switch  mechanism  was  confirmed.  From  this  result, we can think that the idea we thought is feasible.</p>

		<h2>Mismatch</h2>
		<p>Besides,the  experiment  for  the  ON/OFF  switch  mechanism  of  fluorescent molecules isconducted byusing mismatched base pairs. As a result, an ON / OFF  mechanism is  achieved,  but  it  did  not  reachthe  point  where  the convergence value decreased from the initial concentration or the time of the OFF state was controlled. The current switch circuitdelay mechanism using mismatched  base  pairs  can  be  implemented  with  a  seesaw  gate  and  is expected  to  be achievedin  future  research. Also, as  an  alternative  tomismatched base pairs,special self-bindings such as hairpin loops and bulge loops can be used to implement this idea.</p>

		<h2>DNA origami</h2>
		<p>This  time,  the  design  was  based  on  origami,  but  some  disadvantages  arise  from  the  use  of 
origami. One of them is about the strength of DNA origami. As shown in the experiment, the planar  structure  of  DNA  origami  is  neatly  sheet-like and  rectangular  as  designed,  but  even though the origami is made, it can be confirmed that it is distorted or twisted. Since DNA is not  as  hard  as  chemical  fibers,  it  is  thought  that  deformed  ones  are  born.  Therefore,  even though it can be designed to perform the strand displacement reaction on DNA origami, it seems difficult to create a clean form.</p>
		<div class="space"></div>
		<p>This is thought to be improved by creating an environment in which the planar structure of DNA origami becomes a sheet. Specifically, the method of fixing the four corners of the DNAorigami rectangle with pins appears, but there are a lot of materials to consider such as what to fix and what plays the role of the pin Not realistic. Therefore, a more conceivable concrete plan  is  a  method  of  incorporating  DNA  origami  into  a  DNA  origamithat  has  a  nano-sized material  such  as  a  device  and  a  mass  (weight?).  I  think  that  this  substance  gives  weight  to light DNA (depending on the arrangement of the substance) and can suppress  movements that  lead  to  deformation.  In  addition,  although  the  rectangle  was  adopted  in  this  research, there is a possibility that it can be solved by changing the shape. In that case, it is necessary to consider the aspect depending on the size and weight of the material.</p>
		<div class="space"></div>
		<p>I think that the deformation of the origami can be suppressed by making the DNA origami as the foundation of several layers. Or there are plenty of ways to find it through trial and error.</p>

		<h2>For display</h2>
		<p>We  would  like  to  propose  the  idea  of developing “pixels”.  In  general,  pixels  used  in  a  color display are expressed using three primary colors of R (red), G (green), and B (blue). In order to follow this, fluorescent molecules that emit three primary colors are attached to the planar structure created by DNA origami. To fluoresce the colors to be expressed based on the three primary  colors,  it  is  considered  that  various  colors  can  be  expressed  by  causing  these fluorescent  molecules  to  react  while  calculating  the  corresponding  quenching  molecules. However,  the  possibility  of  fret  formation  by  attaching  three  fluorescent  molecules  on  one plane must be considered here. However, DNA uses four bases, and there is a blueprint on the plate  made  with  DNA  origami.  Therefore,  we  think  that  it  is  possible  to  calculate  the distance at which frets do not occur and to design each of the fluorescent molecules attached thereto.</p>

		<p>Most of the parts used in this project, including DNAo, consist of DNA. Therefore, it has a high affinity in vivo and has the potential to cause chemical reactions that cannot normally occur. In this project and experiment, it is not assumed to be used in vivo, but if a third party tries to abuse it, it can be injected into the body and used as a crime tool. In addition, if a DNA strand is introduced into a living body, the influence on the genes originally present in the living body must also be considered.</p>
